PROJECT,LINK,DESCRIPTION
Institute for the Exploration of Virtual Realities,http://www.ievr.org,"i.e.VRÃ¿ is an institute within the University Theatre and the Department of Theatre & Dance at the University of Kansas. Our goal is to explore the uses of virtual reality and related technologies and how they may be applied to theatre production and performance. We are very pleased to have a number of generous sponsors of our work. Among these are: Nvidia, Act-3D, and Artifice, Inc."
Religion in Kansas Project,https://ksreligion.omeka.net/,"The Religion in Kansas Project is an open access digital archive that creates and curates online collections of oral histories, digitized ephemera, and digital exhibitions relating to religious experience and diversity in Kansas. Kansas is religiously a microcosm of the nation, with a history reflecting its inhabitants' varied roots and a rich present-day diversity of religious experience."
Black Book Interactive Project,http://bbip.ku.edu/,"The Black Book Interactive Project is an NEH-funded and ACLS-funded collaborative research project that seeks to increase the number of black-authored texts in the study of digital humanities. By making available over 1600 black-authored novels and generating a metadata schema that accounts for race and race-related issues, we will correct the digital divide in black-authored texts."
Emmett Till Memory Project,https://tillapp.emmett-till.org/,"The Emmett Till Memory Project is your complete guide to the legacy of Till?s murder. The app takes users to the most important sites in the Mississippi Delta and beyond. At each site, the app provides expert-vetted narratives, access to relevant archival documents, and a collection of historic and contemporary photographs. The ETMP teaches users what happened at each site in 1955 and how the sites have been commemorated since 1955. By telling Till?s story from the perspective of each site, the app encourages users to wrestle with different versions of Till?s story and think critically about how it has been passed on."
Migration Stories: Africans in Midwestern Communities,http://migrationstories.ku.edu/ ,"Migration Stories seeks to gather stories in various forms about both the experience of immigration for Africans and the impact of changing demographics for Midwestern communities. Throughout our history, personal stories have played a crucial role in defining what it means to be American and in illuminating the meaning of America as a country. For immigrants, stories are a way to integrate themselves into the narrative of the nation even as their stories of migration change that narrative. For those who are a part of host communities, stories about migration are a way to understand the place of new arrivals in their midst, and a way to transform our ideas about what it means to be American."
Interactive Inner Asia,http://iaia.ittc.ku.edu/index.php ,"The project aims to provide a model lexicographic, demographic, and grammatical feature infrastructure, giving users tools to explore Inner Asia, its individual languages, and their contact and change. The con?ver?gence of unrelated languages in Inner Asia is as striking as that of the Balkans, yet the fea?tures of the area?s languages have hardly been compared. The area remains largely undocu?men?ted as a Sprach?bund. Since most of the relevant Inner Asian languages are endangered, we have a nar?row tem?poral op?portu?nity in which to understand these interactions, in order to contribute to typological and contact theory."
Annotated Turki Manuscripts,https://uyghur.ittc.ku.edu/atmo.html ,"The project Annotated Turki Manuscripts from the Jarring Collection Online is an effort to provide better access for the public to materials in the Central Asian manuscripts collected by a number of Swedish scholars and donated by Prof. (and Ambassador) Gunnar Jarring to the Lund University Library in Sweden. The project is directed by Prof. Arienne M. Dwyer and Dr. C. M. Sperberg-McQueen. We focus on non-translated manuscripts written in the the late Chaghatay language of the southern Tarim Basin, in what is today Xinjiang. In partnership with Lund University Library, our aim is to scan many more manuscripts than are currently available; to transcribe a large portion of these, and to provide additional linguistic annotation and translations for select manuscripts. The project also aims to create a digital edition of one manuscript."
Indigenous Critical Media Lab,https://icmlab.ku.edu/ ,"The ICM Lab is a collaborative research and teaching co-op for the exploration of digital arts and research. Based at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS, the goals of the Lab are to:

    provide infrastructure for humanities and arts research based in Indigenous methods, cultural expression and language revitalization
    Rethink methods of digital humanities and media arts from a perspective of Indigenous epistemologies, pedagogies, and protocols
    Build local and regional communities of practice, knowledge sharing and mentorship
    Offer a program of public engagement"
A Black Diamon Among Thim American Wives (A Digital Scholarly Edition),http://scholarlyediting.org/2015/editions/intro.swayzedrama.html ,"A digtial scholarly edition by Laura L. Mielke and Martha Baldwin

This edition of ?Sweethearts? explores both how and why Swayze Americanized Inkle and Yarico in the context of the late 1850s' political and theatrical culture of the United States. We approach this through a historical introduction, a diplomatic transcription of the play, a textual apparatus highlighting selected significant changes to Colman?s original, and a Juxta comparison set by which the reader may further explore the differences between ?Sweethearts? and an 1825 US edition of Colman?s play."
